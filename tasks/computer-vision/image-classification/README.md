# Image classification on CIFAR10 using a simple CNN

This example illustrates image classification using CIFAR 10 dataset. With rather simple CNN it gets 
around 85% accuracy after 150 epochs. You may have to wait a while without GPU though.

- Navigate to tasks/computer-vision/image-classification folder.

- Run the following command:
    `mlflow run .`
    
- After training, you should see a confusion matrix plot and example classifications.
