To test my code:

1. Navigate to `tasks/computer-vision/image-classification`
2. Run `mlflow run .`


Note: You don't have to manually download the dataset -- The code has inbuilt functionality
to perform that automatically (It will be downloaded inside data/ folder).

You just need a few hundred megabytes of space.
